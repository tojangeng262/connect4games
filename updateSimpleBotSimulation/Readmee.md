This is the folder to update my [SimpleBotSimulation](https://github.com/tojangeng262/connect4games/tree/695d0d51fffcc302ad4b825116fc94ffc25f114f/SimpleBotSimulation)


After running the simulation i had in mind that i havent use numpy as my board simulator. So i created a new one using numpy and all the update will be posting in this folder.

**Important Note:** I also add concurrent.future for my simulation while adding the numpy to speed up the process. i will also upload it in this folder.
