#For the next thing im using bot for simulation. 
    For the simulation, First, i defined about the **game board and the game condition**. Heres the code i used
    
[You can see it here!!!](Connect4game_class)

**How This Setup Works**

-Board Initialization:
The Connect4Game class sets up a 6x7 board (by default), initializing all cells to 0 (empty).

-Move Execution and Notation:
make_move(column): Checks if a move in the given column is valid, finds the next open row, places the piece, and logs the move with the move number, player, column, row, and timestamp.
winning_move(piece): Checks the board for any horizontal, vertical, or diagonal win conditions for the specified piece.

-Logging and Analysis:
All moves are recorded in the move_log list. Once the game ends (or after each game), we can call save_game_log() to save the log as a JSON file for later analysis.

Visualization:
print_board() prints the current board state, making it easy to track the game's progression in the console.

After complete the code of game setup, i create a class for bot. this is to make all the bots moves is recorded in the same way as the game logs.

**Standard Bot Interface and Move Format**

-Common Interface
    Every bot should implement a method (for example, choose_move(game_state)) that takes the current game state as input and returns a move. The move will be represented as the column number (0-indexed) where the bot wants to drop its piece.

-Validation Before Deciding
    Move Validity: The bot must first ensure that the move it plans to make is valid—that is, the chosen column isn’t already full.
    Fallback: If its preferred move is invalid, the bot should have a fallback mechanism (e.g., choose a random valid move).

-Move Logging Format
    Once the bot has decided on a column, the game environment will place the piece and record the move. Each move should be logged in a standard format (as we set up earlier), which might include:
        move_number: The sequential move count.
        player: The ID of the player (or bot) making the move (e.g., 1 or 2).
        column: The chosen column for the move.
        row: The row where the piece landed.
        timestamp: The exact time when the move was made.

-Decision-Making Strategy
    Although different bots may have different strategies (random, heuristic, minimax, etc.), they should all:

        -Return a valid column: Ensure that the returned move will result in a legal move.
        -Follow game rules: Not attempt to place a piece in a column that's already full or out of bounds.

-Error Handling and Edge Cases
    Graceful Handling: In case the bot's logic somehow selects an invalid move, it should catch that error and select another valid move.
Time Constraints (if applicable): If you plan on having a time limit per move, all bots should adhere to the same time constraints.
